Write a solution to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Return the result table ordered by student_id and subject_name.

The result format is in the following example.
Each student from the Students table takes every course from the Subjects table.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Students table:

SQL :
select s.student_id,s.student_name,sub.subject_name,
count(e.subject_name) as attended_exams
from
Students s
cross join Subjects sub
left join Examinations e
on s.student_id=e.student_id
and e.subject_name=sub.subject_name
group by s.student_id,s.student_name,sub.subject_name
order by s.student_id,s.student_name

EXPLANATION:
Each student from the Students table takes every course from the Subjects table.IE WHY WE USE CROSS JOIN .NOW  student subject become one table then we will left join it with the examination table 
This LEFT JOIN takes all entries from the student–subject table and only the matching values from Examinations, filling the rest with NULL.
We use LEFT JOIN so that even if a student–subject pair is not found in Examinations, the row is still returned and the count becomes 0
